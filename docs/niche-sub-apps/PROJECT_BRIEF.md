## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**What We're Building:**
Therr App is a location-based social network that connects people through proximity and shared spaces. Unlike traditional social networks that focus on follower counts and global reach, Therr emphasizes local-first community building, in-person interactions, and discovering content from friends when you're physically near where it was posted.

**Why This Project Exists:**
Modern social networks have created a paradox: we're more "connected" than ever yet increasingly isolated. Therr addresses this by rewarding real-world engagement over passive scrolling. The platform incentivizes users to explore their local communities, support nearby businesses, and build meaningful connections with people who share their physical spaces.

**Core Innovation:**
Therr introduces proximity-gated content and social matching. Content "activates" when you're near where it was posted, creating a treasure-hunt dynamic that encourages exploration. The Match Up feature connects users with nearby friends who share common interests, while businesses can claim digital storefronts and geo-fence promotions to drive foot traffic.

**Therr Family of Apps:**
This core codebase serves as the foundation for multiple niche app variants (e.g., Friends With Habits, Teem). Each niche app inherits the core social infrastructure while adding specialized branding, content filtering, and feature customizations controlled by feature flags. All apps share the same authentication API and database, allowing users to move seamlessly between experiences.
