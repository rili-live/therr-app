# Friends With Habits - PROJECT BRIEF & DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT

**Last Updated:** December 28, 2024  
**Project Status:** Pre-Development / Planning Complete  
**Developer:** Solo founder with full-time job and family commitments

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**What We're Building:**  
'Therr: Friends With Habits' is an accountability-based habit tracker where users MUST invite friends to create "pacts" together. The mandatory social mechanic creates viral growth without marketing spend.

**Why This Project Exists:**  
This is a strategic pivot (or fork) of "Therr App" (a location-based social network that failed to gain traction). We're forking the source code and repurposing 60% of the existing infrastructure to enter a lower-competition market with built-in viral mechanics. Authorization will use the same API and database allowing users to authenticate to either app interchangbly. 'Therr: Friends With Habits' is an extension of the Therr, Inc. family of apps.

**Therr Family of Apps:**
These niche apps are a branch and/or child app of Therr App. The general idea is for a niche app to inherit the core foundations of Therr with unique, niche branding, content filtering specific to that branding, and some simple customizations that are controlled by feature flags.

**Core Innovation:**  
Unlike traditional habit trackers (solo experience), 'Therr: Friends With Habits' makes accountability partners mandatory. You literally cannot use the app without inviting at least one friend. This creates exponential organic growth.

## PROJECT CONSTRAINTS (CRITICAL)

### Developer Constraints
- **Time:** 10-15 hours/week (evenings only - maintainer has separate full-time job + growing family)
- **Sales:** Zero sales ability/experience, no time for outreach or networking
- **Marketing:** No budget, no social media expertise
- **Team:** Solo developer (no cofounders, no employees)

### Technical Constraints
- **Existing Codebase:** Built on Therr App mono repo (React Native, Node.js, Typescript) [https://github.com/rili-live/therr-app]
- **Development Speed:** Relying heavily on Claude Code for AI-assisted development
- **Timeline:** 8-12 weeks to MVP launch
- **Resources:** Bootstrapped, minimal external costs

### Success Requirements
- **Must be monetizable within 3-6 months**
- **Must grow organically without paid marketing**
- **Must leverage existing technical infrastructure**
- **Must not require ongoing sales effort**

---

## MARKET OPPORTUNITY

### Market Size
- Global habit tracking market: **$11.4B (2024) → $43.9B (2034)**
- CAGR: **14.4% annually**
- US market: **$5.4B (2024) → $20.8B (2034)**
- 65% of users actively monitor routines
- 48% increase in adult engagement over past year

### The Accountability Gap
- **95% success rate** with accountability partner
- **10% success rate** without accountability partner
- Current habit trackers are primarily solo experiences
- No dominant player in mandatory-social habit tracking

### Competition Analysis
**Existing Players (All Solo-Focused):**
- Streaks, Habitify, Productive, Done, Way of Life, Pact
- None enforce social accountability
- All allow users to work alone

**Why We'll Win:**
- First-mover in mandatory accountability space
- Viral growth built into product (not optional)
- Leveraging proven $11B+ market
- Lower customer acquisition cost (near $0)

---

## PRODUCT VISION

### Core Concept
"The habit tracker that actually works because your friends hold you accountable. Create pacts/bonds with friends, track together, and face real consequences if you break your streak."

### The Viral Loop (Zero Marketing Required)
1. User downloads app
2. **Cannot create habits alone** - MUST invite friend to create first "pact/bond"
3. Friend receives invite → installs app
4. Both users active → habits stick → success posts to feed
5. User wants another habit → creates new pact → invites another friend
6. Friends see pact updates → FOMO → download app
7. **Exponential growth (viral coefficient >1.0)**

### Key Differentiator
Making social accountability **MANDATORY, not optional**. This is uncomfortable but necessary for viral growth. Users can't skip it - the app doesn't work without partners.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2, January 5-15) 
**Goal:** Prepare codebase for rapid AI-assisted development

- [x] Make mono repo fully Claude Code compatible
- [x] Add regression tests across the repo to keep core api, base app, and sub-apps aligned
  - [x] Implement regression tests for main functionality of users-service
  - [x] Implement regression tests for main functionality of messages-service
  - [x] Implement regression tests for main functionality of reactions-service
  - [x] Implement regression tests for main functionality of push-notifications-service
  - [x] Implement regression tests for main functionality of websocket-service
  - [x] Implement regression tests for main functionality of therr-api-gateway-service
  - [x] Implement regression tests for main functionality of TherrMobile React Native codebase
- [ ] Set up modular feature flag system for TherrMobile (utilizing TherrMobile/env-config.js)
  - [ ] Define FeatureFlags enum, types, and brand-specific configs in therr-js-utilities (create `constants/enums/FeatureFlags.ts` with flag names like `ENABLE_MAP`, `ENABLE_PACTS`, `ENABLE_STREAKS`, and `config/featureFlags/` directory with per-brand default configurations for THERR, HABITS, TEEM)
  - [ ] Centralize brand variation and create FeatureFlagContext (move hardcoded `BrandVariations.TEEM` from Layout.tsx, socket-io-middleware.ts, and interceptors.ts to `TherrMobile/main/config/brandConfig.ts`; create `FeatureFlagContext.tsx` with Provider and `useFeatureFlag` hook)
  - [ ] Integrate FeatureFlagProvider into TherrMobile App root (wrap app in App.tsx, ensure initialization before Layout renders, support loading flags based on current brand variation)
  - [ ] Add feature flag support to route configuration and navigation filtering (extend `ExtendedRouteOptions` in routes/index.tsx with `requiredFeatures` array; update Layout.tsx route filtering to hide routes when required features are disabled)
  - [ ] Create FeatureGate component and update MainButtonMenu (build `<FeatureGate feature={...}>` component for conditional UI rendering with AND/OR logic; update MainButtonMenu.tsx to hide/show nav buttons based on flags)
  - [ ] Define HABITS-specific feature flag configuration (disable: Map, Location, Moments, Spaces, Events, generic social feed; enable: Pacts, Invites, Streaks, Consequences, Proof uploads, mandatory invite flow)
  - [ ] Add AsyncStorage persistence for runtime flag overrides (implement flag override storage for A/B testing per Phase 5 requirements; create merge logic in FeatureFlagProvider to combine defaults with overrides)
  - [ ] Add premium feature flags for HABITS monetization (define `PREMIUM_VIDEO_PROOF`, `PREMIUM_ANALYTICS`, `PREMIUM_CUSTOM_CONSEQUENCES`, `PREMIUM_HEALTH_INTEGRATIONS`, `PREMIUM_UNLIMITED_PACTS`; integrate with user subscription status from Redux)
  - [ ] Add feature flag developer tools for debug mode (create dev-only Settings screen or modal to toggle flags at runtime when `__DEV__` is true; persist overrides to AsyncStorage for testing)
- [ ] Upgrade dependencies to latest stable versions
- [ ] Document existing Therr features to repurpose
  - [ ] Document User Authentication & Profiles repurposing (review `users-service/src/handlers/auth.ts`, `users-service/src/handlers/users.ts`, `TherrMobile/main/routes/Login/`, `TherrMobile/main/routes/Register/`; document OAuth flows, profile fields, JWT handling; identify fields to hide/disable for HABITS; deliverable: add HABITS_AUTH_REPURPOSING.md to docs/)
  - [ ] Document Social Connections repurposing for Pacts (review `users-service/src/handlers/userConnections.ts`, `UserConnectionsStore.ts`, `TherrMobile/main/routes/Connect/`, `TherrMobile/main/routes/Invite/`; document connection request flow, database schema; propose `pacts` table schema extending connections; deliverable: add HABITS_PACTS_SCHEMA.md to docs/)
  - [ ] Document Rewards/Points system repurposing for Streaks (review `users-service/src/handlers/rewards.ts`, `userAchievements.ts`, `therr-js-utilities/constants/achievements`; document TherrCoin/AchievementTier mechanics; propose streak-based achievements; deliverable: add HABITS_STREAKS_DESIGN.md to docs/)
  - [ ] Document Check-in mechanism repurposing for Habit Check-ins (review `maps-service/src/handlers/moments.ts`, `MomentsStore.ts`, `reactions-service/src/handlers/momentReactions.ts`; document moments schema and media handling; propose `habit_checkins` table removing geo requirements; deliverable: add HABITS_CHECKINS_DESIGN.md to docs/)
  - [ ] Document Push Notifications repurposing for Habit Reminders (review `push-notifications-service/src/handlers/`, `TherrMobile/main/utilities/pushNotifications.ts`, `therr-js-utilities/constants/enums/PushNotifications.ts`; document FCM setup and notification types; propose habit-specific notification types; deliverable: add HABITS_NOTIFICATIONS_DESIGN.md to docs/)
  - [ ] Document Real-time Updates repurposing for Pact Activity Feed (review `websocket-service/src/handlers/`, `TherrMobile/main/socket-io-middleware.ts`, `TherrMobile/main/routes/Activities/`; document Socket.IO rooms and events; propose pact-specific real-time events; deliverable: add HABITS_REALTIME_DESIGN.md to docs/)
  - [ ] Document Media Upload repurposing for Proof Uploads (review `maps-service/src/handlers/helpers/createMediaUrls.ts`, `MediaStore.ts`, AWS S3 integration; document signed URL flow and media types; propose proof upload requirements; deliverable: add HABITS_MEDIA_DESIGN.md to docs/)
  - [ ] Document Groups repurposing for Pact Management (review `users-service/src/handlers/userGroups.ts`, `UserGroupsStore.ts`, `TherrMobile/main/routes/Groups/`; document group roles, membership, and notifications; propose pact-specific adaptations; deliverable: add HABITS_GROUPS_DESIGN.md to docs/)

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### What Makes This Different from Therr Social
| Therr Social (Failed) | Friends With Habits (Will Succeed) |
|---|---|
| Need critical mass first | Works with 2 people |
| Competes with Instagram/Facebook | No direct competitor |
| Users can use alone | MUST invite friend |
| Hard to monetize (ads) | Clear premium value |
| Marketing intensive | Self-perpetuating |
| Ghost town problem | Small groups thrive |

### Non-Negotiable Design Principles
1. **Mandatory Invites:** Users CANNOT create pacts without inviting friends
2. **Simple First:** Start with core habit tracking, add complexity later
3. **Social Proof:** Show success stories, leaderboards, community wins
4. **Friction Reduction:** Make inviting friends as easy as possible
5. **Premium Value:** Free tier must work well, premium must be compelling

---

## RISK MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Users Don't Invite Friends
**Mitigation:** Make it literally impossible to use app without inviting at least 1 friend. Test messaging in beta to find what resonates.

### Risk 2: Low Premium Conversion
**Mitigation:** Start with generous free tier, introduce premium features users already want (unlimited pacts, video proof, analytics).

### Risk 3: Habit Completion Fatigue
**Mitigation:** Allow flexible pact terms (3x/week instead of daily), focus on small micro-habits, gamify with rewards.

### Risk 4: App Store Rejection
**Mitigation:** Ensure compliance with guidelines, no cash gambling in v1, clear terms of service, privacy policy.

### Risk 5: Technical Debt from Pivot
**Mitigation:** Weeks 1-2 dedicated to cleaning codebase, removing unused features, proper documentation.
