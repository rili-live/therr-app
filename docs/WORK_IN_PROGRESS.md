# Work In Progress — TODO Backlog & Manual Steps

**Last Updated:** April 2026
**Audience:** Developers and coding agents
**Status:** Living document — update when TODOs are resolved or added

> This is the canonical backlog of cross-cutting code TODOs and the operational
> follow-ups required after deploys. It is **not** a feature roadmap — see
> `docs/niche-sub-apps/PROJECT_BRIEF.md`, `docs/GROWTH_STRATEGY.md`, and the
> per-niche project briefs for product direction. The backlog below is sorted
> by **business value** (Tier 1 = revenue-blocking; Tier 5 = nice-to-have),
> and items within each tier are roughly ranked by **impact × effort**.
>
> **Related trackers:**
>
> - `docs/PEER_REVIEW_FOLLOWUP.md` — narrower scope: items deferred during
>   `general → stage` peer reviews (e.g., shared-store unification, shadow→
>   enforce flips, mobile tsc baseline payoff). Use that file when the work
>   originated from a specific review's residue; use this file for
>   long-standing code TODOs and for post-deploy manual steps.

## How to use this document

- **Coding agents:** When you start a session, scan **§ Manual Operational
  Follow-ups** for unchecked items and offer to help the user complete them.
  When you fix a TODO, remove it from this file in the same commit.
  When skills (`/quality-peer-review`, `/quality-peer-review-niche`,
  `/seo-audit`, etc.) discover a manual step required after a code deploy,
  append it to **§ Manual Operational Follow-ups** with a checkbox.
- **Developers:** Use this as the prioritized backlog when you have spare
  time. Tier 1 items are the only ones that should pre-empt active feature
  work on the current niche/general branch.
- **Plausibility:** This audit removed dead-code, debug-print, and duplicate
  TODOs. Everything below has been confirmed plausible against the current
  codebase (April 2026 audit).

# Manual Operational Follow-ups

Items that require human action — typically post-deploy, or external system
configuration that code alone cannot complete. **Coding agents should
proactively encourage the user to check off open items at the start of each
session.** Skills with `Manual Steps Required After Deploying` output should
append new items here rather than only printing them once.

## Standing items (always re-verify after a deploy that touches the area)

- [ ] **Submit / re-submit sitemap to Google Search Console** after any change
  that adds, removes, or restructures SSR routes (`therr-client-web/src/server-client.tsx`,
  `therr-client-web/src/sitemap.ts`). See `docs/GROWTH_STRATEGY.md` Priority 1.
- [ ] **Verify Stripe webhook signature secret** is set in production env after
  a webhook handler change (`therr-services/users-service/src/api/stripe.ts`).
  Mismatched secrets silently 401 — no error is surfaced to the user.
- [ ] **Warm up AWS SES sender reputation** before scaling unclaimed-space
  email batches. Stay ≤ 50/day for the first week; monitor bounce rate < 5%
  in the AWS SES dashboard. See `docs/GROWTH_STRATEGY.md` Email Deliverability.
- [ ] **Confirm Firebase / FCM credentials match the brand variation being
  deployed** (`therr-services/push-notifications-service/src/api/firebaseAdmin.ts`).
  Per-brand Firebase apps are loaded by env var; a stale value will silently
  send pushes from the wrong project.
- [ ] **Run unconsumed migrations** on each service after any change under
  `therr-services/<service>/src/migrations/**` lands on `main`. There is no
  auto-migrate step in the deploy pipeline.
  Command per service: `npm run migrations:run` (verify per-service `package.json`).
- [ ] **Invalidate CDN cache for assets** (`docs/CLOUDFLARE_CDN.md`) after any
  change to global CSS, brand assets, or favicons.

## Pending campaign / outreach actions

- [ ] **Run the first unclaimed-space email batch** (`scripts/import-spaces/send-unclaimed-emails`,
  start with `--city chicago --limit 50`). 90-day validation milestone — see
  `docs/GROWTH_STRATEGY.md`.
- [ ] **Register Apple Developer account and submit iOS build** —
  removes the iOS gap from the B2B pitch.
- [ ] **Run OSM import for Chicago/LA at scale** to populate email inventory.
- [ ] **Run `source-emails-websites` overnight cron for highest-density city**
  to populate `businessEmail` before the next batch.

## Skill-generated items (auto-appended)

> Skills (`/quality-peer-review`, `/quality-peer-review-niche`, `/seo-audit`,
> `/security-review`, `/db-migration-scaffold`) append items to this section
> when their report identifies a step that must run after deploy. Format:
> `[ ] (YYYY-MM-DD, /<skill-name>) <action> — <why>`

<!-- skill-followups:start -->
- [ ] (2026-07-21, bot-personas) Run the `005_bot_users.js` seed on production users-service (`npm run seeds:run` from `therr-services/users-service`) — creates 10 persona-matched bot accounts (isBot=true) for therr-ai-automator content generation. Idempotent (fixed UUIDs, ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING). Optionally set `BOT_SEED_PASSWORD` beforehand; bots never log in, so the default hash is only a placeholder.
- [ ] (2026-07-19, /quality-peer-review) Post-deploy verification for the cross-app push fix: on a device with **both** Therr and Friends with Habits installed, confirm a Therr "New Spots Unlocked" push lands in Therr (not Habits). Existing installs self-heal on next launch — mobile compares its FCM token against `/users/me` and re-registers via `updateUser`, which dual-writes the brand-scoped row — so expect one launch of latency per app before routing is correct.
- [ ] (2026-07-18, leaderboards) After one release cycle with clean shadow logs, flip `UserLeaderboardScoresStore` from `'shadow'` to `'enforce'` mode (users-service `src/store/UserLeaderboardScoresStore.ts`).
- [ ] (2026-07-20, /work-plan) Run `20260720000001_main.invites.brandVariation` on production users-service (`npm run migrations:run`). Adds a NOT NULL `brandVariation` column (default `'therr'`) to `main.invites`, stamped at invite-creation and returned by `getInviteByToken`. Additive and defaulted, so applying it early is safe for the currently-deployed release; if the image ships first, invite creation fails on the unknown column.
- [ ] (2026-07-18, leaderboards) Product/QA note: the HABITS achievement allow-list is re-enabled (habit ladder + socialite + weeklyChampion — reverses the interim a55bce90d policy). Verify in the Friends with Habits build that check-ins surface streak/consistency achievements and that Therr-shaped classes (explorer, influencer…) still do not appear.
- [ ] (2026-07-13, manual) Set the `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` CircleCI
  project env var (full Play service-account key JSON with the "Release manager"
  permission) so the `eas_build_therr_android` job can auto-populate Google Play
  release notes. Until it is set, the release-notes step logs a skip and the
  pipeline still succeeds — notes just won't update. See
  `docs/SECRETS_AND_LOCAL_BOOTSTRAP.md`.
- [ ] (2026-07-03, magic-invite-links) Run the new users-service migrations on production (`npm run migrations:run` in `therr-services/users-service`): `20260703000001_main.invites.token`, `20260703000002_main.invites.reminders`, `20260703000003_main.userStatsAggregations.onboarding`. The invite-token migration backfills a unique token per existing invite row; the onboarding-stat columns are read by the messaging-automator's completion-nudge pass.
- [ ] (2026-07-03, deferred-phone-verification) Frontend follow-up: add a contextual re-prompt when a phone-unverified user hits a `MOBILE_VERIFIED`-gated action (currently only bulk `multi-invite` returns 403). **Corrected 2026-07-14 (/quality-peer-review): the user does not get a generic error — they get nothing at all.** `TherrMobile/main/routes/Invite/PhoneContacts.tsx` ends its invite call with `.catch(() => { /* Error handled silently */ })`, so the 403 is swallowed and the "Invite" button is a silent no-op. This hits the *already-deployed* app (which cannot be force-updated), and now hits **every** new signup, since phone is no longer required to reach `EMAIL_VERIFIED`. Treat as higher priority than originally logged: at minimum surface the 403 as a toast, ideally a "verify your phone to invite" prompt that deep-links to phone verification. Also audit any other action that assumes phone presence.
- [ ] (2026-07-22, retention work) Schedule the HABITS daily partner-activity
  digest: an internal cron (k8s CronJob or equivalent) must POST once daily —
  ideally early evening US time (~23:00 UTC) — to
  `users-service:7771/habits/pacts/digest/run-daily` with headers
  `x-brand-variation: habits` and `x-localecode: en-us`. The route is
  deliberately not exposed through the API gateway. Running it more than once
  a day duplicates streakAtRisk/partnerMissedDay/pactExpiring pushes.
- [ ] (2026-06-11, /memory-management) Activate MemSearch recall — on your local machine, run `pip install 'memsearch[onnx]'` then `scripts/memsearch-index.sh`. First run downloads the bge-m3-onnx-int8 model (~558 MB, HuggingFace, cached permanently at `~/.cache/memsearch/`). No API key needed — fully local ONNX inference on CPU. Re-run after `git pull` to pick up new session logs and external docs. See `docs/MEMORY_SYSTEM_SETUP.md` for team-sharing and Notion/Confluence ingestion setup.
- [ ] (2026-04-25, manual) Run `20260425000004_main.directMessages.brandVariation`
  migration on production messages-service (`npm run migrations:run`). Without it
  the `brandVariation` column does not exist, `searchDirectMessages` fails with a
  SQL error, and the DM thread shows empty even when old messages exist.
- [ ] (2026-04-27, /quality-peer-review) Configure per-brand Firebase service
  account env vars on push-notifications-service production
  (`PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_BASE64_HABITS`,
  `PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_BASE64_TEEM`) — until set, HABITS/TEEM
  pushes fall back to the THERR Firebase project, which is wrong for token
  routing once niche apps go live.
- [ ] (2026-04-27, /quality-peer-review) After one release cycle with clean
  shadow logs, flip `BrandScopedStore` mode from `'shadow'` to `'enforce'` in
  `NotificationsStore`, `UserAchievementsStore`, `UserDeviceTokensStore`,
  `DirectMessagesStore`, `ForumsStore`, `ForumMessagesStore` — comments in each
  store mark this. Same release should also delete the legacy fallback in
  `resolveDeviceTokenForBrand` once `main.userDeviceTokens` is authoritative.
- [ ] (2026-04-27, /quality-peer-review) After the dual-write window closes
  (mobile clients have re-registered against `main.userDeviceTokens`), drop the
  legacy `users.deviceMobileFirebaseToken` column in a follow-up migration —
  documented in `20260425000003_main.userDeviceTokens` migration header.
- [ ] (2026-05-07, /quality-peer-review) (Optional) Set
  `HABITS_FREE_PACT_LIMIT` env var on production users-service if you want to
  override the default of 5. Project brief target is 1 once HABITS payment
  workflow is live and users can actually upgrade — see
  `docs/niche-sub-apps/habits/HABITS_PAYMENT_WORKFLOW.md`. Lowering before
  payments ship will block early HABITS adopters from creating pacts.
- [ ] (2026-05-07, /quality-peer-review) Add new SSR routes to
  `habits.therr.com` sitemap if applicable (`/login`, `/verify-account`,
  `/emails/unsubscribe` — these are `noindex` so likely skip, but the
  sitemap-generator script may still emit them). Re-submit sitemap to Search
  Console after deploy.
- [ ] (2026-05-10, /quality-peer-review) Add `/claim-pact/:token` to
  `habits.therr.com` sitemap if you want Search Console coverage (likely
  skip — the page is a transient install bouncer, not indexable content),
  and confirm Android App Links verification picks up the new
  `assetlinks.habits.json` once habits.therr.com serves it (visit
  `https://habits.therr.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json` and re-run the
  Play Console "App links" check for `com.therr.habits`).
- [ ] (2026-06-05, /quality-peer-review) After deploying the JWT claims-hardening
  change (general→stage→main), confirm `JWT_ISSUER` / `JWT_AUDIENCE` env vars are
  actually present on the running prod pods for users-service, api-gateway, and
  websocket-service (`kubectl describe deploy ... | grep JWT_`). The signer and all
  verifiers must agree per-environment (`https://api.therr.com` in prod, `therr-app`
  audience everywhere); if the deploy pipeline updated the image but did not re-apply
  the deployment manifest's env block, services silently fall back to the
  `therr-api` default — still internally consistent, so issuer-based cross-env token
  separation would be inactive without any error surfacing. Verify, don't assume.
- [ ] (2026-06-08, /quality-peer-review) Run the
  `20260517000001_habits.pact_members.nudgedAt` migration on production
  (users-service: `npm run migrations:run`) after deploying — adds the nullable
  `habits.pact_members.nudgedAt` column the new pact-nudge endpoint writes to via
  `markNudged`. Without it, every nudge call 500s on the `markNudged` update.
- [ ] (2026-06-20, /quality-peer-review) Production CORS is now enforced.
  `therr-api-gateway/src/index.ts` switched prod from `cors()` (allow-all) to
  `cors(corsOptions)` gated on `URI_WHITELIST`. Before deploying to prod, confirm
  `URI_WHITELIST` (comma-separated, exact scheme+host, no trailing slash) on the
  api-gateway includes EVERY production web origin: `https://www.therr.com`,
  `https://therr.com`, the dashboard origin, and any niche web domains
  (`https://habits.therr.com`, `https://teem.therr.com`, …). Any browser origin
  not listed will be rejected at CORS preflight and the web/dashboard apps break.
  Mobile is unaffected (sends no Origin header). Verify the env block is actually
  applied to the running pod, not just the image.
- [ ] (2026-06-20, /quality-peer-review) `JWT_SECRET` and `JWT_EMAIL_SECRET` are
  now hard-required at boot — api-gateway middleware (`authenticate`,
  `authenticateOptional`, `authenticateUnsubscribe`) throws at import if missing,
  and users-service `validateEnv` lists them in `requiredKeys`. Confirm both are
  present on prod api-gateway AND users-service before deploy; a missing var now
  crash-loops the service on startup instead of silently signing/verifying with an
  empty secret.
- [ ] (2026-06-20, /quality-peer-review) Generic gateway rate limit was lowered
  from 1000 → 300 req/min per IP (`therr-api-gateway/src/middleware/rateLimiters.ts`).
  After deploy, watch for a spike in 429s — clients behind carrier-grade NAT or a
  shared corporate/office egress IP collectively count against one bucket and may
  trip the lower ceiling. If false positives appear, raise the limit or move to a
  per-user/token keyed limiter.

# TODO Backlog by Business Value

## Tier 1 — Revenue-Blocking & Trust-Critical

These TODOs directly block the **B2B-first** revenue funnel
(`docs/GROWTH_STRATEGY.md`) or expose user data / spoofable mechanics. Fix
before any consumer growth investment.

### 1.1 SEO completeness (B2B funnel — Step 2 of 8)

The space landing page **is** the B2B sales pitch. Missing OG/meta on
sibling content types (moments, user profiles) leaks indexing weight and
breaks share previews from claim-emails.

_All open Tier 1.1 items closed (2026-05-11)._

### 1.2 Spoofable / unauthenticated mutation endpoints

These reaction/activation endpoints are public and can be triggered by an
unauthenticated client to mutate engagement metrics on demand. This corrupts
analytics that the B2B dashboard charges for.

- `therr-services/reactions-service/src/handlers/momentReactions.ts:12, 77` —
  Endpoint should be secure/non-public
- `therr-services/reactions-service/src/handlers/thoughtReactions.ts:12, 62` —
  Same
- `therr-services/reactions-service/src/handlers/spaceReactions.ts:57, 126` —
  Same
- `therr-services/reactions-service/src/handlers/eventReactions.ts:10, 53, 111`
  — Same
- `therr-api-gateway/src/services/maps/router.ts:144` — Backend logic to
  prevent location spoofing (rapid-change detection)

### 1.3 User deletion completeness (GDPR / app-store compliance)

The user-deletion path drops the row in users-service but leaves orphans in
notifications, messages, forums, websocket sessions, and cloud media. This
is a privacy-policy violation and an Apple/Google review risk.

- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/users.ts:1041` — Delete
  notifications in users service
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/users.ts:1042` — Delete messages
  in messages service
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/users.ts:1043` — Delete forums
  / forumMessages
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/users.ts:1046` — Delete user
  session from websocket-service redis
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/users.ts:1047` — Delete user
  media from cloud storage

### 1.4 Auth / billing-email integrity

- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/auth.ts:279` — Prevent users
  claiming the same billing email as another user (duplicate-charge / refund
  dispute risk)
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/auth.ts:69` — Mitigate user
  with multiple accounts attached to same phone number
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/users.ts:619` — Don't allow
  updating phone number unless already verified
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/userConnections.ts:44` —
  RSERV-24: Get requestingUserId from header token, not request body
  (impersonation vector)
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/users.ts:703, 911` — Investigate
  flagged security issue (open as of audit date)

### 1.5 Payment / subscription closure

- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/users.ts:148` — Use
  paymentSessionId to fetch subscription details and add accessLevels (the
  Stripe checkout completes but the user account is not upgraded with tier
  metadata)
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/auth.ts:67` — Same path on auth
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/payments.ts:53` — Only update
  user if subscription has started free trial or paid

### 1.6 Unscoped user / connection endpoints (cross-brand leakage)

`searchUsers` and `findPeopleYouMayKnow` were brand-scoped during the Phase 5
brand-isolation work, but their siblings on the same identity-shared
`main.users` / `main.userConnections` tables were not. Because `main.users` has
no brand column (membership lives in the `brandVariations` JSONB array), an
endpoint that omits `brandContainment` silently returns **every** brand's
accounts — a Habits or Teem user sees Therr profiles, which undermines the
premise of the niche apps. These fail open and produce no error, so they will
not surface until a user reports it.

Audited 2026-07-20 (handler-level, users-service). Each needs a judgment call
on whether brand scoping is correct — direct-link profile views may legitimately
be brand-agnostic, but discovery and contact-matching paths are not.

- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/userConnections.ts:661` —
  `getUserConnection` has no brand filter. Needs a judgment call first: it reads a
  single connection by `(requestingUserId, acceptingUserId)`, so it is a targeted
  lookup rather than discovery. Separately, `requestingUserId` comes from the route
  param and is never checked against the caller's token — the IDOR question is
  probably the more valuable one here
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/users.ts:841` —
  `updateLastKnownLocation` is not brand-aware (lower risk — a mutation on the
  caller's own row, listed for completeness)

Re-audited 2026-07-20 (/work-plan) — three entries in the original audit were
misdiagnosed and are **not** bugs. Recording the findings so they are not
re-flagged:

- `getUserByPhoneNumber` (users.ts:393) is **not** the contact-matching path. Its
  only caller is the api-gateway phone-verification route
  (`therr-api-gateway/src/services/phone/router.ts:60`), which uses it to enforce
  "one personal + one creator + one business account per phone number". Brand
  scoping it would *break* that anti-abuse rule by letting the same phone register
  again under each brand. Phone-book contact matching is `findUsersByContactInfo`,
  which is already brand-scoped
- `getUser` (users.ts:369) and `getUserByUserName` (users.ts:456) are deliberately
  brand-agnostic: both back direct-link and SEO-indexed profile views, so scoping
  them would 404 valid cross-brand profile links. Decision is now recorded in a
  comment on each handler
- `clearUserDeviceToken` (users.ts:1321) looks correct as written — it deletes via
  `deleteByToken`, and FCM token strings are unique per device *install*, so each
  brand's app holds a distinct token and deletion by token cannot hit the wrong
  app. Worth a confirming read of `UserDeviceTokensStore.deleteByToken` before
  deleting this note outright

Closed 2026-07-20 (/work-plan): `searchUserPairings` is now brand-scoped via a new
`brandVariation` arg on `UsersStore.searchUserSocials` (regression tests added).
`getInviteByToken` now resolves cross-brand *by design* and returns the invite's
origin `brandVariation` (new `20260720000001_main.invites.brandVariation` migration)
so the landing page can route the invitee to the right app.

Frontend follow-up for the invite change (therr-client-web, separate commit — the
backend half only makes the field available):

- Invite-landing page — consume the new `brandVariation` field from
  `GET /users/invites/:token` and deep-link the invitee to the app the invite was
  minted in. Until this lands, a Habits invite opened on a Therr-branded landing
  page still points the user at the Therr install

Related routing hygiene, found while fixing the `POST /users/search` 400 on
2026-07-20 (gateway `/users/:id` was registered before the literal routes and
shadowed `/users/search`, `/users/search-pairings`, `/users/forgot-password`,
and `/users/notifications`): the other gateway routers have not been audited
for the same param-before-literal ordering bug. A shadowed route fails with a
validation 400 that looks like a client payload bug, so these are expensive to
diagnose.

- `therr-api-gateway/src/services/*/router.ts` — Audit every router for
  `:param` routes registered before literal sibling routes on the same method
  and path prefix. Prefer a startup assertion or lint rule over a one-time
  sweep, since new routes reintroduce the bug

---

## Tier 2 — Consumer Growth Engine (Habits, Push, Engagement)

The viral loop in Friends With Habits (`docs/niche-sub-apps/HABITS_PROJECT_BRIEF.md`)
and the engagement roadmap (`docs/PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_ENGAGEMENT_ROADMAP.md`)
depend on these working correctly.

### 2.1 Push notification engagement

- `therr-services/push-notifications-service/src/handlers/helpers/areaLocationHelpers.ts:222`
  — RDATA-3: Smart rules around when to send push notifications
- `therr-services/push-notifications-service/src/api/firebaseAdmin.ts:676` —
  RDATA-3: ML to predict whether to send a push
- `therr-services/push-notifications-service/src/api/firebaseAdmin.ts:200, 222`
  — Add brandVariation to dynamically set app bundle identifier (per-brand
  Firebase routing)
- `therr-services/push-notifications-service/src/api/firebaseAdmin.ts:262` —
  iOS Notification Service Extension so iOS can fetch message content before
  showing
- `therr-services/push-notifications-service/src/api/firebaseAdmin.ts:312` —
  Use brandVariation for icon color
- `therr-services/push-notifications-service/src/handlers/notifications.ts:47, 112`
  — Endpoint should accept a type parameter
- `therr-services/websocket-service/src/handlers/messages.ts:168` — Send a
  push notification to each user in the room (excluding sender) — DM
  re-engagement is currently silent

### 2.2 Pact / habit infrastructure (HABITS-specific)

These TODOs live in shared backend and `therr-react`, so they ship from
`general` even though the consumer is the HABITS app. None today block the
MVP, but several block the **viral** loop in Phase 3.

- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/userConnections.ts:724` —
  RSERV-32: Return associated users (same as search userConnections does)
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/users.ts:454` — Implement
  prediction algorithm for relevant user discovery (powers "people you may
  know" → invite chains)
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/socialSync.ts:95, 115, 124, 134`
  — "Clout Score" calculation (gates premium tier, see HABITS brief)
- `therr-public-library/therr-react/src/redux/actions/Users.ts:347` —
  RMOBILE-26: SSO logout action (HABITS uses same auth — affects multi-app
  account switching)

### 2.3 Direct-message engagement loop

The websocket service currently relies on socket presence for unread state,
which fails on app-killed iOS — users see read state on a phone that never
saw the message.

- `therr-services/websocket-service/src/handlers/messages.ts:25, 137` —
  RSERV-36: Derive `isUnread` from frontend message instead of socket
  presence
- `therr-services/websocket-service/src/handlers/rooms.ts:55` — Same
- `therr-services/websocket-service/src/handlers/messages.ts:116, 190` —
  RSERV-36: Emit error message to user
- `therr-services/websocket-service/src/handlers/rooms.ts:92` — Same

### 2.4 Reactions / bookmarks (engagement signals)

- `therr-services/websocket-service/src/handlers/reactions.ts:13, 62` —
  Notify active users on bookmark of moment/space/thought (drives back-to-app
  loops)

### 2.5 HABITS payment workflow (Phase 4 monetization)

The free-tier pact gate is wired (`isPactCapExempt` in `pacts.ts`, env var
`HABITS_FREE_PACT_LIMIT`, default 5; pact-create returns HTTP 402 when
exceeded). The actual purchase flow is documented in
`docs/niche-sub-apps/habits/HABITS_PAYMENT_WORKFLOW.md` — 4 components still
to build:

- Stripe Product + webhook handler that grants `AccessLevels.HABITS_PREMIUM`
  on subscription activation and removes it on cancellation.
- Web checkout page on `habits.therr.com` (Stripe Checkout, hosted) gated
  by a short-lived JWT minted by the mobile app.
- Mobile paywall UI (`UpgradePaywall.tsx`) that opens the web URL in the
  external browser on the 402 response.
- `habits://upgrade-complete` deeplink handler that refreshes the user's
  access levels.

Once shipped, lower `HABITS_FREE_PACT_LIMIT` env var on prod from 5 to 1 to
match the project brief target.

## Tier 3 — Operational Quality (Scale, Performance, Cost)

The platform handles ~50 users today but the SEO + outreach push will create
a step-function in load. These items prevent that load from breaking the
service or burning unbounded cost.

### 3.1 Hard caps that will throttle growth

- `therr-services/reactions-service/src/store/EventReactionsStore.ts:97, 109`
  — RSERVE-52: Remove hard limit on reaction-count fetch
- `therr-services/reactions-service/src/store/MomentReactionsStore.ts:91` —
  Same
- `therr-services/reactions-service/src/store/SpaceReactionsStore.ts:99, 111`
  — Same
- `therr-services/reactions-service/src/store/ThoughtReactionsStore.ts:91` —
  Same
- `therr-services/websocket-service/src/store/redisClient.ts:17` — RSERV-6:
  Configure redis clusters
- `therr-services/websocket-service/src/store/redisClient.ts:30` — Use
  separate publish and subscribe Redis hosts

### 3.2 Cost / billing protection

- `therr-public-library/therr-react/src/services/MapsService.ts:424` — Use
  Google Maps `sessiontoken` to prevent over-billing on autocomplete
- `therr-services/maps-service/src/handlers/createMediaUrls.ts:46, 59` —
  Cache signed-URL responses per user with TTL to cut S3 API spend

### 3.3 Read-path performance hot spots

- `therr-services/users-service/src/store/ThoughtsStore.ts:333, 340` — Try
  redis/cache before DB; broader optimization
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/userConnections.ts:166` —
  Collapse multiple DB requests into one
- `therr-services/users-service/src/store/UserConnectionsStore.ts:250` —
  Compare query plans and use `findUserConnections` if faster
- `therr-services/push-notifications-service/src/handlers/locationProcessing.ts:160`
  — Cache nearby spaces along with discoverable areas
- `therr-services/reactions-service/src/handlers/moments.ts:47` — Switch
  pagination from offset to cursor (`last id` filter)
- `therr-services/reactions-service/src/handlers/events.ts:49` — Same
- `therr-client-web-dashboard/src/utilities/media.ts:17` — Signed-URL
  generation is too slow
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/EditMoment/index.tsx:242` — Image signing too slow
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/EditSpace/index.tsx:350` — Same
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/EditThought/index.tsx:176` — Same
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/Events/EditEvent.tsx:310` — Same
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/Groups/EditGroup.tsx:380` — Same
- `TherrMobile/main/utilities/getActiveCarouselData.ts:33, 128` — Sort on
  server; avoid loading unnecessary data
- `TherrMobile/main/utilities/content.ts:49` — Content filtering is too slow
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/Areas/Nearby/NearbyWrapper.tsx:182, 451` — Reduce
  duplicate requests; throttle
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/Map/index.tsx:1247` — Consolidate multiple map
  requests into one dynamic request
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/Map/index.tsx:207-209` — `mapStateToProps`
  returns new `{}` fallbacks every render (`reactions || {}` etc.); freeze
  module-level empties so child memoization isn't defeated on every state
  update
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/Map/TherrMapView.tsx` — wrap per-marker render
  output in a `React.memo`'d component keyed by stable id; the
  `events.map` / `moments.map` / `spaces.map` projections are unmemoized
  and re-run on every parent render
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/Notifications/index.tsx` — migrate `FlatList`
  to `@shopify/flash-list` (already in deps, currently zero usages),
  memoize the `Notification` row component, add `removeClippedSubviews`
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/Connect/index.tsx` — migrate to FlashList
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/DirectMessage/index.tsx` — migrate to FlashList
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/Groups/index.tsx`,
  `routes/Areas/AreaCarousel.tsx`, `routes/Areas/MyLists.tsx`,
  `routes/ManageSpaces/index.tsx`,
  `routes/Invite/components/CreateConnection.tsx` — props-only FlatList
  tuning: `removeClippedSubviews`, `windowSize`, `maxToRenderPerBatch`,
  `initialNumToRender`, `getItemLayout` where row height is constant; wrap
  rows in `React.memo`
- ~~New `TherrMobile/main/utilities/signedUrlCache.ts`~~ — *investigated
  and dropped*: Map already dedupes via the Redux `content.media` cache
  before calling `MapsService.fetchMedia`
  (`TherrMobile/main/routes/Map/TherrMapView.tsx:573`), and each Edit
  upload constructs a unique filename from the message text so an LRU
  keyed on filename never hits. Caching completed signed URLs would
  also be unsafe on retry (returns the failed URL). The remaining
  "image signing too slow" cost is the network round-trip itself —
  fix is server-side (e.g., pre-warm S3 credentials or move signing
  in-process) rather than a client cache
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/Map/index.tsx` `componentDidMount` — wrap
  non-critical socket subscriptions, analytics setup, and reaction
  prefetches in `InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions(...)` to defer
  work off the cold-start critical path
- `TherrMobile/main/getStore.tsx` — verify `redux-logger@3.0.6` is gated
  on `__DEV__`; confirm production bundle from `npm run ios:bundle:release`
  does not contain it

### 3.3.1 Mobile New Architecture follow-ups

Higher-value items deferred from the cheap-wins batch above because they
cross either the dependency-bump or migration-step risk threshold. Land
these after items in 3.3 are merged and a perf baseline is captured.

- Replace `AsyncStorage` in `redux-persist` with `react-native-mmkv`
  (already in deps at 3.3.3). 10–50× faster cold reads; needs a one-shot
  persisted-state migration step on first launch after the swap.
- Adopt `@shopify/flash-list` across the remaining ~26 `FlatList` usages
  beyond the three hot screens already in 3.3.
- `TherrMobile/main/components/BaseImage.tsx` — replace RN `Image` with a
  caching image component (`expo-image` or `react-native-fast-image`) for
  persistent disk cache; touches 24+ call sites and changes loading-state
  semantics, so audit each consumer.
- iOS New Architecture enablement: explicit `:fabric_enabled => true` and
  `:new_arch_enabled => true` in `TherrMobile/ios/Podfile`; per-pod
  Fabric-compat audit (react-native-maps, lottie-react-native,
  react-native-linear-gradient, react-native-image-crop-picker,
  react-native-webview).
- Replace deprecated `react-native-image-crop-picker@0.51.1` (used in
  Map and 5 Edit* screens) with a maintained Fabric-compatible
  alternative.
- Bump `react-native-linear-gradient` 2.8.3 → 3.x (Fabric support).
- Audit `lottie-react-native@7.3.5` Fabric path on Android with New Arch
  on; today only one usage in `Map/index.tsx`.
- Promote React Compiler from annotation mode (`'use memo'` opt-in) to
  `infer` mode on selected route trees once per-marker memoization and
  list migrations are merged so Compiler-generated memo doesn't fight
  hand-written memo.

### 3.4 Resilience & error paths

- `therr-api-gateway/src/middleware/rateLimiters.ts:9` — Add store fallback
  to prevent single source of failure
- `therr-api-gateway/src/utilities/isBlacklisted.ts:3` — Move blacklist from
  in-memory array to DB
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/campaigns.ts:118` — Parse error
  messages so the dashboard can surface them
- `TherrMobile/main/socket-io-middleware.ts:11` — Fallback to polling / REST
  when socket.io fails (offline-first plan, Phase 2+)
- `TherrMobile/main/components/LoginButtons/AppleSignInButton.tsx:42` — Call
  `signOut()` when token expires
- `TherrMobile/main/components/LoginButtons/GoogleSignInButton.tsx:66` —
  Same
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/Login/LoginForm.tsx:113` — Handle malformed
  Google SSO key errors gracefully
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/EditMoment/index.tsx:459` — Delete uploaded file
  if moment creation fails
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/EditSpace/index.tsx:517` — Same for space
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/Events/EditEvent.tsx:586` — Same for event
- `therr-client-web-dashboard/src/components/forms/EditCampaignForm.tsx:27` —
  Refresh OAuth token if almost expired
- `therr-client-web-dashboard/src/routes/Campaigns/CreateEditCampaign.tsx:309, 363, 574, 618, 707, 861`
  — Error handling, alerts, multi-provider OAuth in campaign create/edit
- `therr-client-web-dashboard/src/routes/OAuth2Landing.tsx:75` —
  React Router v6 navigation flicker after new-user login (also at
  `routes/Login/index.tsx:76`, `routes/Register/index.tsx:69`)

## Tier 4 — Content Safety, Data Quality, Observability

Required for Apple/Google App Store compliance, paid-business trust, and
post-incident debuggability. None block today's revenue but each is a
ticking risk.

### 4.1 Content moderation (NSFW / mature)

The audit identified 7+ instances of "leaves room for gap of time where
users may find explicit content before flag updated" — this is the single
biggest App Store rejection risk.

- `therr-services/maps-service/src/handlers/moments.ts:466` — Abstract and
  add nudity filter (sightengine.com)
- `TherrMobile/main/components/0_First_Time_UI/onboarding-stages/CreateProfilePicture.tsx:76`
  — Same
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/EditMoment/index.tsx:259` — Same
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/EditThought/index.tsx:190` — Same
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/Events/EditEvent.tsx:327` — Same
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/Groups/EditGroup.tsx:397` — Same
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/Settings/index.tsx:352` — Same
- `therr-services/maps-service/src/handlers/spaces.ts:140, 764, 968, 985, 1002`
  — Tighten window where unflagged explicit content is reachable
- `therr-services/maps-service/src/handlers/events.ts:435` — Same
- `therr-services/maps-service/src/handlers/moments.ts:313, 511` — Same
- `therr-services/maps-service/src/handlers/spaces.ts:255, 1083` — Check
  user settings for mature-content visibility
- `therr-services/maps-service/src/handlers/events.ts:1068` — Same
- `therr-services/maps-service/src/handlers/moments.ts:1261` — Same
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/thoughts.ts:253, 469` — Same
  for thoughts
- `therr-services/maps-service/src/handlers/helpers/index.ts:105` — Fine
  tune content-safety classifier
- `therr-services/maps-service/src/handlers/helpers/index.ts:163` — Email
  admin on flagged content

### 4.2 Locale-aware date formatting (RFRONT-25)

Dates are formatted server-side in `en-US` and shipped to mobile/web. Three
locales are supported (`en-us`, `es`, `fr-ca`) — Spanish/French users see
English-formatted timestamps.

- `therr-services/websocket-service/src/index.ts:42` — Localize dates
- `therr-services/websocket-service/src/handlers/auth.ts:35, 114` — Same
- `therr-services/websocket-service/src/handlers/messages.ts:28, 140` —
  Same
- `therr-services/websocket-service/src/handlers/rooms.ts:35, 106` — Same
- `therr-services/messages-service/src/handlers/forumMessages.ts:63` — Same
- `therr-services/messages-service/src/handlers/forums.ts:403` — Same

  Same
- `therr-public-library/therr-react/src/redux/actions/Messages.ts:16, 48` —
  Format with locale timezone in mind
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/Map/index.tsx:251` — Derive locale from user
  settings instead of hardcoded `en-US`
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/Map/TherrMapView.tsx:153` — Same

### 4.3 Phone-number internationalization

- `therr-public-library/therr-js-utilities/src/normalize-phone-number.ts:10`
  — "We can't assume US, this is BAAAAD" — international users currently
  fail phone verification
- `therr-api-gateway/src/services/users/validation/users.ts:10` — RMOBILE-26:
  Centralize password requirements
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/Settings/index.tsx:627` — RMOBILE-26: Use
  `react-native-phone-input`

### 4.4 Data quality / audit trail

- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/socialSync.ts:196` — Store
  response details in `socialSyncs` for audit trail
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/socialSync.ts:272` — Verify
  `requestId` for OAuth security
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/userConnections.ts:549` — DB
  constraint preventing `requestingUserId == acceptingUserId`
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/users.ts:879` — Reward
  increment/decrement on blockchain for auditability (long-term, but is the
  legal record once paid tier exists)
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/auth.ts:181, 182` — Encrypt
  stored OAuth `access_token`s in DB
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/auth.ts:315` — Same

  `createdAt` more secure (only for social sync)
- `therr-services/maps-service/src/store/MomentsStore.ts:497` — Same
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/userVerification.ts:183` —
  Supply user agent to determine web vs mobile
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/users.ts:1076, 1149` — Same
- `therr-services/websocket-service/src/index.ts:155, 156, 278, 279` — Get
  platform / brandVariation from request instead of hardcoded default
- `therr-services/push-notifications-service/src/handlers/helpers/areaLocationHelpers.ts:65`
  — Gradually reduce `tempLocationExpansionDistMeters` toward zero as users
  join (avoids stale "discovery radius" once cities densify)
- `therr-api-gateway/src/services/users/router.ts:569` — Validate AWS SNS
  signatures on bounce webhook

### 4.5 Observability gaps

- `therr-public-library/therr-react/src/redux/actions/Users.ts:287` — Send
  registration / login event to Google Analytics and Datadog
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/auth.ts:242` — Log OAuth
  endpoint response
- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/users.ts:98` — Better error
  logging
- `therr-services/maps-service/src/handlers/events.ts:981` — Make this
  endpoint internal-only
- `therr-services/maps-service/src/handlers/spaces.ts:347` — Check user is
  part of organization and has access to view (currently any auth'd user can
  view any org space)
- `therr-services/maps-service/src/handlers/createMediaUrls.ts:8, 11` — More
  security on media access (verify requesting user has permission)
- `therr-services/maps-service/src/store/EventsStore.ts:37` — Same
- `therr-services/maps-service/src/store/MomentsStore.ts:33` — Same
- `therr-services/maps-service/src/store/SpacesStore.ts:57` — Same
- `therr-services/maps-service/src/handlers/spaces.ts:1053` — Verify address
  is close to provided lat/lng

### 4.6 Test coverage gaps

- `therr-services/users-service/src/handlers/users.ts:331` — Unit test
  needed
- `therr-services/users-service/tests/unit/handlers-helpers-user.test.ts:64`
  — Add tests for `sendEmail` args
- `therr-services/maps-service/src/handlers/createMediaUrls.ts:46` — Test
  cache-control headers
- `therr-services/maps-service/src/store/SpacesStore.ts:508` — Test with
  various interests lists
- `therr-services/push-notifications-service/src/api/firebaseAdmin.ts:617` —
  Make data-only message and test

## Tier 5 — Refactoring & Developer Experience

Pure code-quality work. None of these change user-visible behavior. Pick
these up only when in the area for another reason — do not schedule them.

### 5.1 Redux state consolidation (dashboard)

The dashboard repeatedly threads `spacesInView` / `campaignsInView` through
component trees. Hoist to Redux for a single source of truth.

- `therr-client-web-dashboard/src/routes/Campaigns/BaseCampaignsOverview.tsx:47`
- `therr-client-web-dashboard/src/routes/InfluencerPairings/index.tsx:106`
- `therr-client-web-dashboard/src/routes/Dashboards/BaseDashboard.tsx:99`
- `therr-client-web-dashboard/src/routes/Dashboards/OverviewModules/OverviewOfSpaceMetrics.tsx:34`
- `therr-client-web-dashboard/src/routes/Dashboards/OverviewModules/OverviewOfCampaignMetrics.tsx:20`
- `therr-client-web-dashboard/src/routes/ManageSpaces/index.tsx:84`
- `therr-client-web-dashboard/src/routes/Dashboards/BaseDashboard.tsx:207` —
  Get current user spaces and organization spaces from backend (not frontend)

### 5.2 Redux duplication (mobile)

- `TherrMobile/main/routes/ViewUser/index.tsx:330, 355` — "Ugly code for
  reactions" — refactor to consolidated reaction-state pattern
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/ViewUser/index.tsx:409, 422, 433, 446` — Move
  reaction calls from Redux actions to direct service requests where the
  side-effect is unwanted
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/Connect/index.tsx:180, 185` — Connect Redux UI
  prefetch (currently dead state)
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/Notifications/index.tsx:258` — Same prefetch
  pattern
- `TherrMobile/main/components/Input/HeaderSearchUsersInput.tsx:76` — Move
  search state to Redux to share with Contacts page

### 5.3 SQL / store-layer cleanups

- `therr-services/reactions-service/src/handlers/momentReactions.ts:18, 96` —
  Use `INSERT … ON CONFLICT … MERGE` for upserts (also at
  `thoughtReactions.ts:23, 81`, `spaceReactions.ts:65, 172`,
  `eventReactions.ts:18, 72`)
- `therr-services/users-service/src/store/UserConnectionsStore.ts:161` —
  RSERV-25: Make this dynamic to accept multiple queries
- `therr-services/messages-service/src/store/CategoriesStore.ts:22` — Match
  `searchCategories` for infinite scroll
- `therr-services/messages-service/src/store/ForumsStore.ts:87` — Same for
  `searchForums`
- `therr-services/messages-service/src/store/ForumsStore.ts:262, 284` —
  Wrap update in transaction
- `therr-services/messages-service/src/store/ForumCategoriesStore.ts:22` —
  Match `searchForumCategories`
- `therr-services/maps-service/src/store/SpacesStore.ts:673` — Implement use
  of `Categories.ts`
- `therr-public-library/therr-react/src/redux/reducers/content.ts:59` —
  Replace `Set` dedup with `Map` keyed on area ID

### 5.4 Magic strings / constants

- `therr-services/websocket-service/src/index.ts:265` — Use constants for
  disconnect reasons instead of magic strings
- `therr-services/maps-service/src/handlers/spaces.ts:985`,
  `events.ts:1074`, `moments.ts:1267` — Use env variables
- `therr-services/websocket-service/src/store/redisSessions.ts:24, 25, 37, 38`
  — RSERV-4: Namespace by app+ip; create token to send back to frontend
- `therr-services/websocket-service/src/store/redisSessions.ts:5, 11` —
  Strategy for grouping users in rooms; reuse connections
- `therr-api-gateway/src/services/maps/validation/areas.ts:21, 28, 70` —
  Add granularity to media validation
- `therr-api-gateway/src/services/phone/router.ts:91, 134` — Use Redis
  pipeline
- `therr-api-gateway/src/services/maps/limitation/map.ts:36` — Reduce or
  limit to admin users
- `therr-api-gateway/src/store/MapsService.ts:90`,
  `UsersService.ts:19, 27` — Centralize cache invalidation in a base class
- `therr-api-gateway/src/store/index.ts:7` — Move shared store code to
  `therr-public-library`

### 5.5 Mobile UX polish

These small toasts/dialogs each individually look minor but the
post-onboarding feel is the sum of them.

- `TherrMobile/main/routes/Login/LoginForm.tsx:133`,
  `routes/Register/RegisterForm.tsx:294` — RMOBILE-26: UI alert for
  registration failures
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/Areas/Nearby/NearbyWrapper.tsx:505, 532, 571`,
  `routes/Map/index.tsx:1087, 1172` — Display modal/instructions for
  enabling location after `never_ask_again`
- `TherrMobile/main/components/Input/HeaderSearchUsersInput.tsx:95` — Red
  dot to show filters enabled (blocked: user-search has no filter UI yet)
- `TherrMobile/main/components/UserContent/UserImage.tsx:33` — Image
  cropping fails with some datatypes; upgrade or disable crop initially

### 5.6 Backwards-compat sweeps to drop after rollout

These exist purely as transitional shims. Each carries a "delete after X"
note that should be honored on a calendar reminder.

- `therr-services/maps-service/src/handlers/createMediaUrls.ts:17` —
  "Provides temporary backwards compatibility" — verify if still needed
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/Map/index.tsx:672`,
  `utilities/getActiveCarouselData.ts:129` — Remove `translate()` after
  backwards-compatibility rollout
- `TherrMobile/main/routes/EditMoment/index.tsx:253`,
  `routes/EditSpace/index.tsx:360`,
  `routes/Events/EditEvent.tsx:321`,
  `routes/Groups/EditGroup.tsx:391`,
  `routes/ViewMoment/index.tsx:379`,
  `therr-client-web-dashboard/src/utilities/media.ts:55` — Replace `media`
  field with `medias` after backend migration
- `therr-services/maps-service/src/handlers/moments.ts:653` — Endpoint
  marked for deletion after it has served its purpose (verify zero callers
  before removing)
- `react-native.config.js:10` — LogRocket workaround on Android; re-test
  after a future RN/LogRocket upgrade

### 5.7 Build / config tidy-ups

- `therr-client-web/webpack.app.config.js:121`,
  `therr-client-web-dashboard/webpack.app.config.js:105` — Only load the
  current theme's CSS instead of all themes
- `therr-client-web/src/index.tsx:21`,
  `therr-client-web-dashboard/src/index.tsx:15` — RSERV-8: Use themes
  endpoint to dynamically load theme styles
- `therr-client-web/src/server-client.tsx:38`,
  `therr-client-web-dashboard/src/server-client.tsx:28` — RFRONT-9: Replace
  the `window is undefined` SSR hack
- `therr-client-web-dashboard/src/server-client.tsx:124` — Define all
  favicon variations (sizes, platforms)
- `therr-client-web-dashboard/src/components/Layout.tsx:172` — Persist
  integrations to localStorage with TTL
- `therr-client-web-dashboard/src/api/login.ts:11` — Use scopes needed for
  meta ads / campaigns
- `_bin/pre-commit.sh:16` — Use `CHANGEME.json` to verify dev changes and
  rebuild affected pages
- `_bin/pre-push.sh:16` — Add conditions to prevent bad commits
- `_bin/cicd/publish.sh:104` — Output a list of all services that should be
  deployed for the given commit
- `TherrMobile/env-config.js:43` — Import config from a shared location
  instead of duplicating
- `scripts/generate-content/utils/contentSchema.ts:143` — Implement planned
  new content section types per `docs/CONTENT_GUIDES_ROADMAP.md`
- `TherrMobile/main/**` (~56 import sites) — Migrate
  `react-native-vector-icons` (deprecated monolith, ships classic-JSX-
  transform builds → React 19 warning currently suppressed in `App.tsx`) to
  per-family packages: `@react-native-vector-icons/material-icons`,
  `/font-awesome`, `/font-awesome-5`, `/ionicons`, `/octicons`. Removes the
  suppression and unblocks future RN/React upgrades.

# How to maintain this document

## When closing a TODO in code

1. Remove (or update) the source TODO comment as part of the same commit.
2. Delete the corresponding bullet in `WORK_IN_PROGRESS.md` (do **not** strike
   through; the file is not a journal).
3. If the TODO referenced a ticket prefix (`RSERV-`, `RFRONT-`, `RMOBILE-`,
   `RDATA-`), search the file for siblings — these are usually clusters that
   were intended to be closed together.

## When discovering a new TODO

Add it to the appropriate tier. If you can't decide between two tiers, place
it lower (the cost of under-prioritizing is a delay; the cost of over-
prioritizing is wasted top-of-list attention).

Use the same one-line format as existing entries: `path:line — short verb-
phrase description`. Keep it terse — this file is read by humans and agents
many times more often than it's written.

## When adding a Manual Operational Follow-up

Append to **§ Manual Operational Follow-ups** with a checkbox. If the item
was generated by a skill run, place it under "Skill-generated items" between
the `<!-- skill-followups:start -->` and `<!-- skill-followups:end -->`
markers, prefixed with the date and originating skill:

```
- [ ] (2026-04-26, /quality-peer-review) Run main.userDeviceTokens migration on
  users-service after deploy — required by Phase 5 brand-isolation work.
```

When a follow-up is completed, **delete** the line. Do not move it to a Done
section — this list is meant to be short.

## When two trackers seem to overlap

`WORK_IN_PROGRESS.md` (this file) is for long-standing code TODOs and
post-deploy operational steps. `PEER_REVIEW_FOLLOWUP.md` is for residue
deferred during a specific peer review. If a peer-review item is
broadly applicable beyond that single review, link it from here too. Don't
duplicate the body — a one-line cross-reference is enough.

## Audit cadence

A full re-audit (`grep -rn "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK\|XXX"` across the monorepo
followed by tier reassignment) is cheap and worth running:

- After any major feature ships (scan for resolved TODOs to delete)
- Before each quarterly planning cycle (re-tier; demote stale items to
  Tier 5 or remove)
- Whenever the file grows past ~600 lines (signals stale entries
  accumulating)
