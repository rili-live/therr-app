# Rili Public Library: React Components
We have included this set of React Components to provide common, Rili javascript functionality that was abstracted for re-use.

## How to Include a component
Simply add an import to the top of a file, ie.
```javascript
import * as ComponentModule from 'rili-public-library/react-components/some-component';
etc.
```
