# Rili Public Library: Utilities
We have included this set of helper utilities to provide common, Rili javascript functions that were abstracted for re-use.

## How to Include a utility
Simply add an import to the top of a file, ie.
```javascript
import { configureTranslator } from 'rili-public-library/rili-js-utilities/localization';
import * as scrollTo from 'rili-public-library/rili-js-utilities/scroll-to';
etc.
```
