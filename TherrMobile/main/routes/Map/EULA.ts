This EULA agreement shall apply only to the Software supplied by Teem herewith regardless of whether other software is referred to or described herein. The terms also apply to any Teem updates, supplements, Internet-based services, and support services for the Software, unless other terms accompany those items on delivery. If so, those terms apply.
