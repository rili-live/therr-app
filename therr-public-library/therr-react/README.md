# Therr Public Library: React Components
We have included this set of React Components to provide common, Therr javascript functionality that was abstracted for re-use.

## How to Include a component
Simply add an import to the top of a file, ie:
```javascript
import * as ComponentModule from 'therr-public-library/therr-react/some-component';
etc.
```

## Nomenclature
* Area: A generic term refering to a moment, space, thought, etc. This is anything with an area on the map
